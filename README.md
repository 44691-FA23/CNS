Campus Navigation Service
--
The "Campus Navigator and Services" is a novel web application that has been developed with the primary purpose of helping new students acclimate to their college campus more easily during their initial days. This application is a step beyond conventional navigation tools, as it provides directions and integrates supplementary features like food delivery and parking space identification, all within the context of the college campus.
The main objective of this project is to improve the overall campus experience for students by making it more convenient, accessible, and user-friendly.
